# nonstandard problem - a quine
# write a program that prints its own source code
#
# the execution of the program should return a string 
# with the source code

#ex. the eraborus quine

# def prints_itself():
#     #If I want to print the source code, I need to make it printable first

#     #The more characters I have, the more I have to handle
#     # (especially special characters)
#     wholefile = compile(every_line_in_file)
#     for char in wholefile:
#         print(char)

# string_obj = "def print_itself():";"print()"
# def print_itself():
#     print()
